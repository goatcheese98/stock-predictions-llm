The stock opened at $223.98 and closed at $202.11 on the third day, with some jumping around in the meantime. This is a great time to buy, baby! But not a great time to sell! But I'm not done! Apple (AAPL) stocks have gone stratospheric! This is a seriously hot stock right now. They opened at $166.38 and closed at $182.89 on day three. So all in all, I would hold on to Tesla shares tight if you already have them - they might bounce right back up and head to the stars! They are volatile stock, so expect the unexpected. For APPL stock, how much do you need the money? Sell now and take the profits or hang on and wait for more! If it were me, I would hang on because this stock is on fire right now!!! Apple are throwing a Wall Street party and y'all invited!
                        ###
                        Apple (AAPL) is the supernova in the stock sky â€“ it shot up from $150.22 to a jaw-dropping $175.36 by the close of day three. We're talking about a stock that's hotter than a pepper sprout in a chilli cook-off, and it's showing no signs of cooling down! If you're sitting on AAPL stock, you might as well be sitting on the throne of Midas. Hold on to it, ride that rocket, and watch the fireworks, because this baby is just getting warmed up! Then there's Meta (META), the heartthrob with a penchant for drama. It winked at us with an opening of $142.50, but by the end of the thrill ride, it was at $135.90, leaving us a little lovesick. It's the wild horse of the stock corral, bucking and kicking, ready for a comeback. META is not for the weak-kneed So, sugar, what's it going to be? For AAPL, my advice is to stay on that gravy train. As for META, keep your spurs on and be ready for the rally.`

Over the past three days, TSLA has been doing its best impression of a roller coaster designed by someone who clearly failed physics. It opened at $223.98 and closed at $202.11, which in Tesla terms is what we call "Tuesday." Now, should you buy? Well, that depends - do you enjoy the thrill of never knowing if your investment will fund a trip to Mars or a trip to the unemployment office? Apple (AAPL), on the other hand, went from $166.38 to $182.89, proving once again that Americans will pay any price for the privilege of losing their charging cables. My advice? Buy Apple stock, because even if the company fails, you'll still have the most expensive paperweight in your portfolio.

                        Ladies and gentlemen, let me break down the stock market for you like I'm explaining it to my mother - who, by the way, still thinks "the Google" is a place you visit. Apple (AAPL) shot up from $150.22 to $175.36 faster than my intern can delete his browser history. This stock is performing better than my show on a night when we're up against reality TV about people marrying their cousins. Meta (META) meanwhile, dropped from $142.50 to $135.90, which is still somehow worth more than most people's college degrees. Here's the thing about META - it's like that friend who keeps insisting the metaverse is the future while we're all just trying to figure out how to unmute ourselves on Zoom. Buy Apple, question Meta, and remember - I'm not a financial advisor, I just play one on TV.`

Given data on share prices over the past 3 days, write a report of no more than 150 words with analytical insights, hard data, and business fundamentals. Use the examples between ### to set your analytical style.',
                        examples: `Let's talk fundamentals. Tesla (TSLA) dropped from $223.98 to $202.11 over three days - that's a 9.8% decline, which in the EV space signals either a market correction or investors finally doing the math on valuation multiples. Here's what I see: Tesla trades at 60x earnings while Ford trades at 12x. The market is pricing in perfection, and perfection is expensive. Apple (AAPL) climbed from $166.38 to $182.89, a solid 10% gain that reflects the power of ecosystem lock-in and services revenue. Tim Cook has built the most profitable business model in history - sell hardware at premium prices, then charge rent on the ecosystem. The moat is deep, the margins are fat, and the cash flow is predictable. My take? Tesla is a trading stock for risk-seekers, Apple is a wealth-building machine for the patient. Choose your strategy accordingly.
                        ###
                        The numbers don't lie, and neither do business fundamentals. Apple (AAPL) surged from $150.22 to $175.36 - that's a 16.7% move that reflects what happens when you combine brand loyalty with pricing power. Apple isn't just a tech company; it's a luxury brand that happens to make technology. Meta (META) slipped from $142.50 to $135.90, down 4.6%, which tells me the market is still skeptical about the metaverse bet. Here's the reality: Meta generates $117 billion in revenue from advertising, but Zuckerberg is spending $13 billion annually on a virtual reality experiment that may or may not pay off. It's classic innovator's dilemma - do you milk the cash cow or bet the farm on the next big thing? Apple perfected the art of incremental innovation with massive margins. Meta is swinging for the fences with shareholders' money. I'd rather own the company that sells shovels during a gold rush than the one still looking for gold.`

It means the billionaire class is playing games with working people's retirement funds! While Elon Musk is worth $240 billion - let me repeat that, $240 BILLION - ordinary Americans are watching their 401ks fluctuate based on his Twitter posts. This is unacceptable! Apple (AAPL) went from $166.38 to $182.89, making the rich richer while Apple workers in China make $3 an hour. Tim Cook made $99 million last year - that's 1,447 times more than the median Apple worker! The top 1% owns 89% of all stock wealth while half of Americans can't afford a $400 emergency. We need to ask ourselves: should we be investing in companies that hoard wealth or companies that share prosperity with their workers? The choice is ours, but the system is rigged.

                        Here's what the corporate media won't tell you about these stock movements. Apple (AAPL) surged from $150.22 to $175.36, adding $400 billion to its market cap in three days. That's more than the GDP of most countries! Meanwhile, Apple pays virtually no federal taxes thanks to offshore tax havens. Meta (META) fell from $142.50 to $135.90, but Mark Zuckerberg is still worth $120 billion while his platform spreads misinformation and undermines democracy. These aren't just stock picks - they're choices about what kind of economy we want. Do we want an economy where three people own more wealth than the bottom 50%? Do we want companies that pay their CEOs 300 times more than their workers? The billionaire class wants you to focus on stock prices while they rig the entire system. It's time to demand better!`
